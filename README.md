  To generate a team profile, first run ```npm install``` the required dependencies as specified in package.json:
  
`npm init`

`npm install --save-dev jest`

The application can be invoked with node `index.js`

## Usage 
When you run node `index.js` in your terminal, the app uses the inquirer package to prompt the user with a series of questions about your team members.
Once all the questions have been answered, the data is collected and your HTML file will be created.
